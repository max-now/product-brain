# Product Strategy — Full Guide (Playbook)

## Before You Start - Prerequisites Checklist

**Essential Requirements:**
- [ ] Company mission/vision clearly defined and accessible
- [ ] Leadership commitment for 8-12 week process
- [ ] Access to user data, analytics, and research
- [ ] Working group availability (minimum 4 people × 2-4 hours/week during prep)
- [ ] Budget for potential user research gaps (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Calendar blocking for strategy sprint week (all working group members)

**Success Indicators:**

- Team debates are unproductive or circular
- Clear disconnect between mission/vision and day-to-day roadmap decisions

---

## Basics for Newcomers

**Definition:** Strategy bridges mission/vision and plan (roadmap). It forces disciplined choices on where to focus (3–5 pillars), where not to focus (non-goals), and why these choices create maximum impact.

**Purpose:** Deploy scarce resources for maximum impact; reduce unproductive debates; clarify success measures and guardrails; align teams on "why these bets."

**Scope:** 
- **Small "s"**: 2-year present-forward strategy (solving current product problems)
- **Big "S"**: 3/5/10-year future-backward strategy (aspirational futures)

**Key Components of Good Strategy:**
1. **3-5 Strategic Pillars** (focus areas)
2. **Explicit Non-Goals** (what we won't do)
3. **Clear Rationale** (why these choices)
4. **Winning Aspiration** (2-year headline)
5. **Success Measures** (KPIs and guardrails)

Each cluster becomes an opportunity area:
- "Users can't find features" → "Discovery & Findability"
- "New user abandonment" → "Onboarding & Activation" 
- "Enterprise integration gaps" → "Platform & Extensibility"

**11:15 AM-12:00 PM: Scoring Framework Review**

**The 4 Scoring Dimensions (1-5 scale each):**

1. **Expected Impact (1-5)**
  - 5: Affects majority of users frequently with high pain/value
  - 4: Affects many users regularly with moderate-high pain/value  
  - 3: Affects some users regularly OR many users occasionally
  - 2: Affects some users occasionally with moderate pain/value
  - 1: Affects few users infrequently with low pain/value

2. **Certainty of Impact (1-5)**

4. **Uniqueness of Levers (1-5)** ⭐ *Often missed but critical*
  - 5: Strong unique advantages (brand, data, technology, partnerships)
  - 4: Some unique advantages that provide differentiation
  - 3: Can differentiate through execution but not structurally unique
  - 2: Slight advantages but mostly playing on level field
  - 1: No clear advantages—would be playing catch-up

**Afternoon Session (1 PM - 5 PM): Scoring & Selection**

**1:00-3:00 PM: Individual Scoring**
- Each working group member scores each opportunity area on all 4 dimensions
- Use provided scoring rubric and evidence from preparation phase
- No discussion during individual scoring

**3:00-3:15 PM: Break**

- Direct manager/VP of Product
- Key functional leaders (Engineering, Design, Data)
- Major customer stakeholders (Sales, Customer Success for B2B)

**1:1 Review Process:**
- **Pre-meeting**: Send strategy document 2 days in advance
- **Meeting Duration**: 60-90 minutes per gatekeeper
- **Agenda**: 
  - 15 min: Context and process overview
  - 30 min: Walk through pillars and rationale
  - 30 min: Discussion, concerns, adjustments
  - 15 min: Next steps and expectations

**Common Gatekeeper Concerns & Responses:**
- **"These pillars feel too broad/narrow"** → Show scoring rationale and evidence
- **"What about [pet project]?"** → Explain how it fits (or doesn't) within pillars or non-goals
- **"Timeline feels aggressive"** → Walk through capacity planning and dependency analysis
- **"How do we know this will work?"** → Share measurement plan and early validation approach

**Adjustment Guidelines:**
- **Minor language/framing changes**: Acceptable and expected
- **Pillar priority ordering**: Can adjust based on compelling new information
- **Major pillar changes**: Requires strong evidence and working group reconvening

## Anti-Patterns & Common Pitfalls

**Strategy Selection Anti-Patterns:**
- ❌ **Function-shaped pillars**: "Improve mobile experience" 
- ✅ **Choice-shaped pillars**: "Enable discovery of advanced features"

- ❌ **Pillars without rationale**: Just listing focus areas
- ✅ **Evidence-based pillars**: Clear scoring and supporting data

- ❌ **No explicit non-goals**: Everything feels like priority
- ✅ **Clear non-goals**: Explicit choices about what not to focus on

**Process Anti-Patterns:**
- ❌ **Skipping user observation**: Strategy becomes abstract
- ✅ **Grounding in user reality**: Direct exposure to user problems

- ❌ **No visual communication**: Strategy document is text-heavy
- ✅ **Illustrated concepts**: Design sprint makes pillars tangible

- ❌ **Poor stakeholder sequencing**: Surprising gatekeepers
- ✅ **Structured rollout**: 1:1s → group review → team roadshows

**Measurement Anti-Patterns:**
- ❌ **Vanity metrics focus**: Measuring activity vs. outcomes
- ✅ **Impact-focused metrics**: Measuring user and business value

- ❌ **No baseline measurement**: Can't track progress
- ✅ **Clear baselines**: Know where you're starting from
