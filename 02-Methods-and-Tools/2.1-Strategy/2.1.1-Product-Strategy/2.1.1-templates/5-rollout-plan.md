#### Team Roadshow Session Template

**Session Structure (60 minutes, 8-10 people)**

**Why Strategy Now (10 minutes)**
```
Facilitator Script:
"You might wonder why we spent 8 weeks on strategy when we already have roadmaps and OKRs. 

The issue: Teams were debating 'what to build' without clear 'why this over that' criteria. Leadership interviews revealed [key insight]. User research showed [key finding]. 

Strategy gives us shared criteria for making roadmap decisions."
```

**Pillar Walkthrough (25 minutes)**

**Common Questions & Responses:**

**Q: "What about [current project not aligned with pillars]?"**
A: "Great question. Let's look at how [project] supports [relevant pillar] or if it should be reconsidered given our new focus."

**Q: "These pillars feel too broad/narrow."**
A: "The scoring process helped us balance scope. Here's the evidence that led to this level of focus..."

**Q: "How do we handle urgent requests that don't fit pillars?"**
