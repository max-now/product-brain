## Day-by-Day Sprint Structure

### Day 1: Alignment & Divergent Ideation

**Morning Session (9 AM - 12 PM): Strategic Alignment**

#### 9:00-9:30 AM: Sprint Kickoff & Expectations

**Facilitator Opening Script:**
```
"Welcome to our design sprint! Over the next 3 days, we'll create visual concepts that bring our strategic pillars to life.

Our goal is NOT to design final solutions, but to help stakeholders understand what each pillar could look like in practice. Think 'concept car' that shows possibility and direction.

Success means: When someone reads our strategy document, they can visualize what we're building toward."
```

**Set Sprint Rules:**
- Phones away during focused work
- All ideas welcome—no judgment during ideation
- Timebox everything—better to finish imperfectly than not finish
- Focus on communication over perfection

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Design Sprint Anti-Patterns

**❌ Problem: Getting too detailed in concept development**
- **Symptom**: Spending time on pixel-perfect designs or complete user flows
- **Solution**: Set strict time limits and focus on communication over perfection

**❌ Problem: Creating features instead of experience concepts**
- **Symptom**: Concepts look like feature specifications rather than user experience illustrations
- **Solution**: Always start with user scenarios and emotional outcomes

**❌ Problem: Avoiding technical constraints entirely**
- **Symptom**: Concepts that are impossible to implement with current capabilities
- **Solution**: Include engineering perspective in feasibility discussions

**❌ Problem: Concepts that don't connect to strategy**
- **Symptom**: Visually appealing concepts that don't illustrate pillar meaning
- **Solution**: Regularly check concepts against pillar definitions and success criteria

### Facilitation Challenges

**Challenge: Participants struggling with ambiguity**
- **Solution**: Emphasize "concept car" analogy and provide examples from other industries

**Challenge: Perfectionism slowing progress**
- **Solution**: Strict timeboxing and "better done than perfect" mindset

**Challenge: Technical constraints dominating discussion**
- **Solution**: Separate "possibility" exploration from "feasibility" assessment

**Challenge: Stakeholder expectations for detailed specifications**
- **Solution**: Clear communication about design sprint purpose and outputs

## Adaptation Guidelines

### Team Size Variations

**Small Team (3-4 people):**
- Compress to 2-3 days

**Large Team (6+ people):**
- Create sub-teams for parallel concept development
- Add additional review/feedback sessions
- Consider multiple concepts per pillar
- Include more diverse perspectives in evaluation

### Remote/Hybrid Adaptations

**Fully Remote:**
- Use collaborative design tools (Figma, Miro, Mural)
- Break into smaller virtual rooms for focused work
- Async concept development between synchronous sessions
- Digital voting and prioritization tools

**Hybrid (Some Remote):**
- Ensure remote participants can see and contribute to physical artifacts
- Use digital tools even in-person for inclusivity
- Rotate facilitation between locations
- Extra attention to remote participant engagement

### Industry/Context Adaptations

**B2B/Enterprise Products:**
- Include workflow integration concepts
- Focus on productivity and efficiency gains
- Consider administrator and end-user perspectives
- Address implementation and change management

**Consumer Products:**
- Emphasize emotional experience and delight
- Focus on accessibility and simplicity
- Consider social and sharing aspects
- Address onboarding and habit formation
