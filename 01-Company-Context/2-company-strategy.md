# HeyMax Strategy Overview

## Introduction

This document outlines HeyMax's strategic priorities, key initiatives, success metrics, and technology strategy. It bridges the gap between our vision of making travel universally accessible through Max Miles and the execution required to become the leading travel rewards platform for consumers and businesses.

> How we create and align strategy
- We use a lightweight Product Strategy framework to bridge mission/vision to an actionable plan through 3–5 strategic pillars, explicit non-goals, and clear rationale.
- Framework and guides: see strategy methods in `../02-Methods-and-Tools/2.1-Strategy/2.1.1-Product-Strategy/`
- Operationalisation: Pillars map to OKRs (Objective/KR IDs) and are communicated via monthly newsletters and stakeholder updates.

## Three-Prong Strategy

HeyMax's strategy is built on three reinforcing platform effects that compound to create defensible competitive advantages:

### 1. **Max Miles Platform Effect**
Build Max Miles as an open-ecosystem currency that scales reach and value for both consumers and businesses.

**The Flywheel:**
```
Value of Max Miles → Business Adoption → Consumer Adoption → Scaled Value + Cost Advantage
```

**Why It Matters:**
- Max Miles' open ecosystem (earn everywhere, redeem across partners) creates winner-take-all dynamics
- As Max Miles becomes more valuable through wider acceptance, businesses adopt it to attract consumers
- Consumer adoption drives merchant demand, which funds higher earning rates, creating a reinforcing loop
- Scale drives cost advantages in redemption partnerships (volume-based pricing) and technology amortization

**Strategic Imperatives:**
- Make Max Miles the most desirable travel currency through universal acceptance and transparent value
- Build merchant density faster than competitors to establish "default" status for travel rewards
- Create switching costs through accumulated miles balances and habitual earning behaviour

---

### 2. **Traveller's Platform Effect**
Capture and deliver value from travel entropy—the fragmentation between travellers and businesses across destinations, channels, and touchpoints.

**The Insight:**
```
Travellers → Spend in Travel + Destination → Business Desire to Engage → Incentives to Max Miles Platform
```

**Why APAC Travel Fragmentation Creates Opportunity:**
- APAC travellers are high-value but fragmented from a business perspective (inbound tourists, business travellers, digital nomads)
- Businesses (hotels, attractions, F&B, retail) have limited ways to reach and engage inbound travellers at scale
- Traditional loyalty programs fail for travellers because rewards don't transfer across borders
- HeyMax aggregates traveller demand, making the fragmented market addressable for businesses

**Strategic Imperatives:**
- **Capture Consumer Attention**: Insert HeyMax into frequent, high-value traveller interactions (plan → book → travel loop)
- **Map Right Business to Right Consumer**: Use intent signals and location data to serve contextually relevant offers
- **Make Max Miles Highly Desirable**: Position as the universal travel currency that works everywhere, unlike fragmented loyalty programs

---

### 3. **Simplify and Maximise for Consumers**
Own the complete traveller journey (plan → book → travel) by offering a better way to perform tasks while earning continuously.

**Product Strategy:**
HeyMax inserts itself into frequent, high-value interactions between travellers and businesses. We offer a better way to perform tasks, then partner with businesses to capture value and pass it back as Max Miles.

**For Users:**
- **Core Loop**: Earn and manage rewards continuously across everyday transactions and travel spending
- **Travel Journey Support**: Plan → Book → Travel—HeyMax maximises value and eliminates worry at each stage
- **Continuous Earning**: Unlike traditional programs (earn only on flights), HeyMax enables earning everywhere

**Target User Evolution:**
1. **Phase 1 (Current)**: Start with travellers who already value miles and understand loyalty programs
2. **Phase 2 (Expansion)**: Simplify earning/redeeming to appeal to casual travellers who find traditional programs too complex
3. **Phase 3 (Mass Market)**: Eventually expand to anyone who travels, regardless of loyalty program sophistication

**Why Travellers?**
- APAC is travel-heavy but fragmented—businesses have limited ways to reach inbound travellers
- Travellers lose access to rewards and benefits when they travel (home-country loyalty programs don't work abroad)
- HeyMax bridges the gap: travellers earn continuously, businesses engage high-spending inbound customers
- This cross-border value exchange is a unique, defensible advantage

---

## Strategic Priorities (How We Execute)

Our strategic priorities operationalise the three-prong strategy through focused execution pillars:

### 1. **Max Miles Ecosystem Expansion**
**Goal:** Establish Max Miles as the dominant open-ecosystem travel currency through merchant density and universal acceptance.

**Ownership:** Monetisation Team (B2B Partnership Enablement)

**Key Metrics:**
- Merchant partner count and category coverage
- Max Miles earning velocity per user
- Max Miles redemption rate and partner fill rate

---

### 2. **Traveller Engagement & Retention**
**Goal:** Capture consumer attention through habitual earning behaviour and become indispensable across the plan → book → travel journey.

**Ownership:** Retention Team (Engagement & Retention Products)

**Key Metrics:**
- Active earners (30-day earning rate)
- Retention (90-day active rate)
- In-app session frequency and engagement depth

---

### 3. **Platform Intelligence & Matching**
**Goal:** Use data and decisioning algorithms to map the right businesses to the right consumers at the right time, maximising value for both sides.

**Ownership:** Shared (Retention Team: consumer intent models; Monetisation Team: merchant ROI optimisation)

**Key Metrics:**
- Offer CTR and conversion rates
- Merchant ROI (incremental GMV / cost)
- Redemption booking success rate

## Non-Goals (Strategic Exclusions)

Explicit choices about what we will NOT pursue to maintain strategic focus:

- **Generic cashback positioning**: We do not compete on cashback rates or commoditised rebates. Our differentiation is travel-specific acceleration, not highest percentage back.
- **Credit card issuance**: We do not become a bank or card issuer. We remain platform-agnostic and integrate with existing payment methods.
- **Direct travel booking inventory risk**: We do not hold airline seats or hotel rooms on our balance sheet. We aggregate redemption demand and partner with suppliers.
- **Enterprise B2B loyalty white-labeling**: We do not become a loyalty SaaS platform for enterprises to run their own programs. We remain a consumer-facing marketplace.
- **Geographic market fragmentation**: We do not launch in markets without sufficient merchant density or redemption partner availability. We prioritise depth over breadth.

## Product Strategy: The HeyMax App

### How HeyMax Supports Our Mission

The HeyMax app executes our strategy by inserting ourselves into frequent and high-value interactions between travellers and businesses. We offer a better way for travellers to perform their tasks, then partner with businesses to capture the value and pass it back to travellers as Max Miles.

**For Users: HeyMax powers your travel through everyday interactions**

At the core, travellers earn and manage rewards continuously across:
- **Everyday spending**: Grocery, fuel, subscriptions, retail—every purchase accelerates your next trip
- **Travel planning**: Search, compare, and wishlist trips while earning Max Miles on research activities
- **Booking**: Earn on flights, hotels, activities, and experiences when you book through partners
- **In-destination spending**: Continue earning while travelling (F&B, attractions, retail, services)

**The Traveller Loop:**
Every trip follows the same pattern:
```
Plan → Book → Travel
```

HeyMax supports each stage:
- **Plan**: Maximise value through deal discovery, price comparison, and earning forecasts ("Book this trip and you'll earn 50,000 miles")
- **Book**: Seamless redemption or earn more miles toward future trips
- **Travel**: Worry-free travel with in-destination offers, location-based earning, and real-time support

**The Continuous Earning Advantage:**
Unlike traditional loyalty programs (earn only on airline spend), HeyMax enables earning everywhere, compressing time-to-redemption from 18-24 months (industry average) to <180 days.

- **Cross-border advantage**: Build unique value through Singapore ↔ Hong Kong travel corridor
- **Platform readiness**: Ensure technology, operations, and partnerships can scale before new market entry

---

### APAC Expansion (2027+)

**Near-Term Opportunities (2027)**
- **Australia**: Mature loyalty market, high travel spend, English-speaking (requires differentiated positioning vs. Qantas/Velocity)
- **Japan**: Premium market, high travel frequency, loyalty sophistication (requires localized approach)

**Medium-Term Opportunities (2028)**
- **Taiwan**: High loyalty program adoption, mature e-commerce, similar psychographics to HK
- **Indonesia**: Largest APAC population, growing middle class, underserved travel rewards
- **Malaysia**: Geographic proximity to Singapore, strong travel ties, English proficiency

**Long-Term Exploration (2029+**)
- **India**: Massive addressable market but requires significant localization and regulatory navigation

---

### Market Entry Criteria

We will only enter new markets when ALL criteria are met:

1. **Merchant Readiness**: 20+ merchants committed to performance-based offers across 5+ high-frequency categories (grocery, fuel, F&B, retail, subscriptions)
2. **Redemption Partner Coverage**: 2+ airline or hotel partners with inventory availability for target market travellers
3. **Payment Infrastructure**: Ability to integrate with dominant payment methods (cards, wallets, BNPL) representing >70% of digital transactions
4. **Regulatory Viability**: Clear legal path to operate as loyalty program without banking/financial services licensing

6. **Operational Capacity**: Customer support, fraud prevention, and compliance capabilities ready for 24/7 market coverage
7. **Travel Corridor Validation**: Demonstrated travel flow between new market and existing markets (e.g., Thailand ↔ Singapore travel volume)

## Technology Strategy

### **Real-Time Decisioning Platform**
**Capability**: Process transaction events, score offers, and personalize experiences in <100ms.

**Why It Matters**: Consumer engagement depends on instant offer relevance. Latency kills conversion.

**Architecture**:
- Event streaming (Kafka/Kinesis) for transaction ingestion
- Low-latency feature store for real-time consumer/merchant attributes
- ML inference at edge for offer scoring and ranking
- Redis/Memcached for sub-10ms response times

**Success Criteria**: p95 latency <100ms, 99.9% uptime

---

### **Multi-Party Attribution Engine**
**Capability**: Measure incremental GMV by comparing test cohorts (exposed to HeyMax offers) vs. control cohorts (not exposed).

**Why It Matters**: Merchant ROI proof is our primary sales tool. Without attribution, we're just another affiliate network.

**Architecture**:
- Randomized control trial (RCT) framework for cohort assignment
- Multi-touch attribution model crediting HeyMax influence across customer journey
- Merchant-specific dashboards showing incremental lift vs. baseline

**Success Criteria**: 95% confidence intervals on incrementality claims, <5% attribution leakage

---

### **Redemption Orchestration Layer**
**Capability**: Aggregate availability across airline/hotel APIs, optimize inventory allocation, and confirm bookings in <24hrs.

**Why It Matters**: Redemption friction kills loyalty program engagement. Instant gratification drives repeat earning.

**Architecture**:
- Direct integrations with GDS (Amadeus, Sabre) and NDC (airline-direct APIs)
- Hotel aggregators (Expedia TAAP, Booking.com) for non-loyalty inventory
- Smart routing algorithm selecting optimal partner based on inventory cost, availability, and consumer preference

**Success Criteria**: <24hr booking confirmation, >90% fill rate, <$5 per-booking processing cost

---

### **Merchant Self-Service Platform**
**Capability**: Enable brands to launch campaigns, set budgets/CPX rates, and track performance without human intervention.

**Why It Matters**: Sales team bandwidth is the primary constraint on merchant growth. Self-serve unlocks exponential scaling.

**Architecture**:
- Merchant portal with campaign builder (offer creative, targeting rules, budget caps)
- Real-time performance dashboards (impressions, clicks, conversions, ROI)
- Automated approval workflows for low-risk offers (rule-based fraud checks)


---

### **Consumer Engagement Stack**
**Capability**: Orchestrate multi-channel communications (push, email, in-app) triggered by earning milestones, redemption opportunities, and merchant offers.


**Architecture**:
- CDP (Segment, mParticle) for unified consumer profile
- Journey orchestration (Braze, Iterable) for lifecycle campaigns
- Predictive send-time optimization to maximize open rates

**Success Criteria**: >30% push opt-in rate, >25% email open rate, >10% weekly active engagement

---

### **Data & Analytics Infrastructure**
**Capability**: Centralized data warehouse enabling self-serve analytics for product, marketing, and merchant success teams.

**Why It Matters**: Data-driven decisions require accessible, trustworthy data. Analyst bottlenecks slow velocity.

**Architecture**:
- Cloud data warehouse (Snowflake, BigQuery) as single source of truth
- DBT for data transformation and business logic
- BI layer (Looker, Tableau) for self-serve dashboards
- Reverse ETL (Census, Hightouch) to activate warehouse data in operational tools

**Success Criteria**: <24hr data freshness, 100% of key metrics accessible via self-serve dashboards

## Competitive Strategy

### vs. Traditional Loyalty Programs (Qantas Frequent Flyer, Velocity)
**Their Strength**: Established networks, direct airline inventory, high brand trust
**Their Weakness**: Siloed ecosystems, slow earning velocity, opaque redemption value

**Our Advantage**:
- **Faster Earning**: Aggregate earning across 100+ merchants vs. single airline spend
- **Universal Wallet**: One pool of miles, not fragmented programs
- **Transparent Value**: Show dollar-equivalent value of miles, not obscured "points"

**Positioning**: "Earn miles 10x faster with every dollar, not just flights"

---

### vs. Cashback Platforms (Shopback, Cashrewards)
**Their Strength**: Simple value proposition (% back), wide merchant networks
**Their Weakness**: Commoditized positioning, low emotional engagement, discount fatigue

**Our Advantage**:
- **Aspirational Framing**: Travel dreams > small rebates
- **Higher Perceived Value**: Miles feel more valuable than cashback due to travel context
- **Merchant Preference**: Performance model > discount model (preserves brand equity)

**Positioning**: "Turn everyday spending into your next holiday, not pocket change"

---

### vs. Credit Card Rewards (Amex, Chase, Citi)
**Their Strength**: Seamless integration (automatic earning), premium positioning, established trust
**Their Weakness**: High fees, restricted eligibility, opaque redemption processes

**Our Advantage**:
- **Inclusive Access**: No credit checks, no annual fees
- **Transparent Redemption**: Search, book, confirm in single flow vs. calling concierge
- **Merchant-Funded**: Consumer gets rewards without paying fees

**Positioning**: "All the rewards, none of the fees—powered by the brands you shop"

---

### vs. Fintech Super-Apps (Revolut, Grab)
**Their Strength**: Multi-product ecosystems, high engagement, venture-backed scale
**Their Weakness**: Diluted value props, complexity, regulatory burden

**Our Advantage**:
- **Single-Minded Focus**: Travel rewards only—no banking, investing, insurance distractions
- **Lighter Regulation**: Loyalty program vs. financial services licensing
- **Emotional Positioning**: Travel aspiration > financial utility

**Positioning**: "The simplest path to your next holiday, not another super-app"

## Risk Mitigation

### **Consumer Adoption Risk**: What if travel aspiration doesn't drive engagement?
**Mitigation**:
- Launch with high-frequency merchants (grocery, fuel) to create habitual earning before redemption intent forms
- A/B test cashback hybrid model (50% cashback, 50% miles) for risk-averse segments
- Partner with travel content creators to seed aspirational storytelling

---

### **Merchant Economics Risk**: What if merchants don't see ROI vs. existing channels?
**Mitigation**:
- Guarantee incrementality via RCT attribution (refund if no lift vs. control)
- Offer risk-free trial campaigns (cap losses at $5K)
- Publish category benchmarks showing HeyMax outperforms coupon/affiliate channels

---

### **Redemption Fulfillment Risk**: What if airline/hotel partners restrict inventory?
**Mitigation**:
- Diversify across 5+ redemption partners (no single point of failure)
- Negotiate minimum inventory commitments in partnership agreements
- Build "cash + miles" hybrid model if pure miles inventory is constrained

---

### **Technology Scalability Risk**: What if platform can't handle 10x growth?
**Mitigation**:
- Cloud-native architecture with auto-scaling from Day 1
- Load testing at 10x current traffic before each growth milestone
- Vendor partnerships (Stripe, AWS) with enterprise SLAs

---

### **Competitive Response Risk**: What if incumbents copy our model?
**Mitigation**:
- Build network effects moat (more consumers → more merchants → better redemption inventory → more consumers)
- Secure exclusive merchant partnerships with 12-month terms
- Invest in brand differentiation that can't be copied overnight

## Strategic Bets (Assumptions That Must Hold)

1. **Travel aspiration is universally motivating enough to drive behavior change** (switching from cashback to miles)
2. **Merchants will allocate budgets to performance-based travel rewards** at premium rates vs. discount channels
3. **Redemption partners will provide sufficient inventory** to meet accelerated earning velocity
4. **Platform intelligence can optimize the three-sided marketplace** better than competitors with more resources
5. **Brand positioning as "Travel Accelerator" will differentiate** from cashback/loyalty incumbents

**Validation Checkpoints**:
- Q2 2026: 50K active earners (proves consumer adoption)
- Q3 2026: 20 merchants @ >3:1 ROI (proves merchant economics)
- Q4 2026: 100 redemptions/month (proves redemption viability)
- Q1 2027: 200K active earners @ <$25 CAC (proves scalable unit economics)
