## Best Practices

1. **Focus on Actionable Info**: Highlight what needs decisions or action
2. **Use Visual Indicators**: Icons make status easy to scan
3. **Include Links**: Direct links to issues/PRs for quick access
4. **Show Trends**: "3 PRs merged this week" vs. just counts
5. **Flag Risks Early**: Stale work, blockers, overdue items
6. **Keep It Current**: Always include date of report

## What to Ask

If the user hasn't provided enough context:
- Which repository should I check?
- What time period (this week, sprint, all time)?
- What milestone or feature should I focus on?
- Do you want issue details or high-level summary?
- Should I compare to previous periods?
- Any specific labels or filters to apply?
