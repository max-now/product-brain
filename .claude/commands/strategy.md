## Best Practices

1. **Start with TL;DR**: Put recommendation in first paragraph
2. **Show Your Work**: Explain how you arrived at the recommendation
3. **Address Alternatives**: Show you considered other options
4. **Be Specific**: Include timelines, metrics, resources needed
5. **Anticipate Objections**: Address concerns proactively
6. **Make It Scannable**: Use headers, bullets, tables
7. **Include Data**: Quantify impact wherever possible
8. **Be Honest About Risks**: No strategy is risk-free

## Memo Types

**Vision Memos**: Paint picture of future state (2-3 pages)
**Decision Memos**: Make choice between options (3-5 pages)
**Planning Memos**: Outline execution strategy (4-6 pages)
**Problem/Solution Memos**: Define problem and propose solution (2-4 pages)
