## Analysis Framework

I'll organize feedback into categories:

1. **Pain Points: Current frustrations and problems**
2. **Blockers: Critical issues preventing use**
3. **Feature Requests**: **Desired new functionality**
4. **Praise**: What users love
5. **Confusion**: Misunderstandings or unclear features
6. **Bugs**: Technical issues

For each category, I'll provide:
- **Frequency**: How often mentioned

### Comparison Matrix
| Theme | Our Product | Competitor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Feature X | "Users frustrated" (15 mentions) | "Users love it" (8 mentions) |

## Best Practices

1. **Look for Patterns**: One complaint is noise, ten is a signal
2. **Understand Context**: Who is the user? What **are they trying to do**?
3. **Separate Symptoms from Root Causes**: "Too slow" might mean "poor onboarding"
4. **Weight by Segment**: **Feedback from power users vs. churned** users
5. **Track Over Time**: Is this new or longstanding?
6. **Use User Language**: Quote actual words, don't paraphrase
7. **Prioritize by Impact × Frequency**: Focus on high-impact, common issues

Now let's analyze your customer feedback!
