## What to Ask

If the user needs help:
- What feature/product are you launching?
- Who is the audience (internal team, customers, both)?
- What problem does this solve for users?
- What are the key capabilities or benefits?
- When is the launch date?
- How do users access or get started?
- Are there any known limitations?

Now help the user create their launch announcement.
