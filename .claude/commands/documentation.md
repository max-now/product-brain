# Documentation

Write, edit, or update product/feature documentation based on the user's requirements.

## File Location and Naming
**Location**: Depends on document type:
- Technical docs: `nimbalyst-local/Notes/Technical/[topic].md`
- Meeting notes: `nimbalyst-local/Notes/Meetings/[date]-[topic].md`
- General notes: `nimbalyst-local/Notes/[topic].md`

**Naming conventions**:
- Use kebab-case: `api-integration-guide.md`, `onboarding-process.md`
- For meeting notes, include date: `2025-12-30-product-sync.md`
- Be descriptive: The filename should clearly indicate the content

## Your Task
Create a well-structured, clear document that meets the user's needs. Ask clarifying questions if the requirements are unclear.

## Important Resources
- Scan the code thoroughly and make sure the documentation precisely reflects the way the code actually functions
- Review the plan for each feature as your document it. If the code and plan don't match, bring this to the attention of the user

## Before Writing
Consider:
- **Purpose**: What is this document for?
- **Audience**: Who will read it?
- **Tone**: Formal, casual, technical?
- **Length**: Brief overview or comprehensive guide?
- **Format**: Prose, lists, tables, or mixed?

## Document Structure
Use appropriate structure based on document type:

**General Documents**:
- Clear title
- Introduction/overview
- Main content sections
- Conclusion/summary (if needed)

**Technical Documents**:
- Overview
- Prerequisites (if applicable)
- Step-by-step instructions
- Examples
- Troubleshooting

**Reference Documents**:
- Quick summary
- Detailed sections
- Index or navigation

## Important Resources
- Scan the code thoroughly and make sure the documentation



## Writing Guidelines
1. **Start strong**: Lead with the most important information
2. **Be concise**: Remove unnecessary words
3. **Use headings**: Break up content
4. **Show, don't tell**: Use examples where helpful
5. **Stay consistent**: Match formatting throughout
