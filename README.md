# 🧠 PM Brain-as-Code

> **Your external product management brain. Single source of truth = latest commit.**

A living knowledge base that bridges the gap between Product Management frameworks and actual operational execution. Git-versioned, shareable, ready to use.

**Product teams drown in blog posts and frameworks** but don't know *how* to run sprint planning on Tuesday morning or write a strategy document by end-of-day. This gives you battle-tested guides, templates, and playbooks. Built for everyone from junior PMs to senior leads.

🚀 **Get started:** clone the repo → add your context → start shipping

## 🚀 How to Get Started

### Option 1: Manual (Copy-Paste into AI Tools)

**Best for:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, or other chat-based AI tools.

1. **Browse** to the folder you need:
  - `01-Company-Context/` – for company strategy, vision, stakeholders
  - `02-Methods-and-Tools/` – for frameworks, guides, templates, playbooks
  - `03-Research-Artifacts/` – for research storage structure
  - `04-Initiatives/` – for opportunity assessments and initiative planning

2. **Before using templates: Braindump first**
  - Don't jump straight to filling templates. Start by dumping your thoughts, ideas, and concerns.
  - Use the braindumping prompts in each framework to capture your raw thinking first.
  - Let your product sense and intuition guide initial thoughts before structuring them.

3. **Copy** the relevant README + template files.

4. **Paste** into your AI chat session with a prompt like:
```
   Here's the structure I use for [product strategy / PRDs / OKRs / etc.].
   
   First, help me braindump my thoughts on [topic]. Quiz me, challenge my assumptions, and help me think through this before we structure it.
   
   Then help me fill it out / adapt it for [my context].
```
4. **Save for reuse** (recommended):
  - Upload files to your AI tool's project feature (ChatGPT's "My GPTs", Claude's "Projects", etc.)
  - Or save the conversation for future reference
  - Reuse templates without re-copying each time

### Option 2: Technical (Clone & Use with IDE AI Tools)

**Best for:** GitHub users with VS Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Replit, or similar IDE AI tools.

1. **Clone** the repo:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/andreaskelm/pm-brain.git
   cd pm-brain
```

2. **Plug in your context:**
  - Replace placeholders in `01-Company-Context/` with your actual vision, strategy, principles
  - Customize templates in `02-Methods-and-Tools/` for your workflows

3. **Start using (think first, structure second):**
  - **Braindump before structuring**: Use the braindumping prompts in each framework to capture your raw thoughts first
  - **Develop product sense**: Use the product sense exercises and reflection prompts to build judgment
  - **Think critically**: Let frameworks guide your thinking, not replace it. Answer the quiz questions honestly.
  - Use frameworks and guides in `02-Methods-and-Tools/` for daily work
  - Store research in `03-Research-Artifacts/`
  - Document initiatives in `04-Initiatives/`

4. **Optional:** Point your IDE's AI tools at this repo as project context.

## 🏗️ System Structure Philosophy

This is a **PM brain-as-code**, not a random notes folder. The directories represent different **types of work** and **layers of your product system**, not a rigid sequential process.

### Four Core Layers

```text
pm-brain/
├── 01-Company-Context/        # 🏢 Strategic foundation (vision, strategy, metrics, stakeholders)
├── 02-Methods-and-Tools/      # 🧭 PM operating system (frameworks, guides, templates, prompts)
├── 03-Research-Artifacts/     # 🔍 Evidence layer (interview notes, synthesis, findings)
└── 04-Initiatives/            # 🚧 Active bets (early thinking, opportunity assessments, docs)
```

### Optional Layers

```text
├── 08-Prototypes/             # 🧪 Experiments and prototype implementations
└── 09-Personal-Context/       # 🧑 Personal notes (keep sensitive content in private fork)
```

## 🔄 Daily Workflow

1. **Reference** `01-Company-Context/` for strategic direction and company information.
2. **Use** `02-Methods-and-Tools/` when you need a process, framework, template, or playbook.
3. **Store** research outputs in `03-Research-Artifacts/` after completing discovery work.
4. **Do** your active product work in `04-Initiatives/` (planning, documenting, iterating).

### How Frameworks Work Together

The frameworks follow a natural product development flow:

**0. Early Thinking** (`04-Initiatives/`) → Capture ideas and hypotheses

**1. Discover** (`2.3-Discovery/`) → Interview users, observe behavior, collect stories

**2. Define** (`2.3.3-Jobs-To-Be-Done/`) → Frame problems as jobs and opportunities

**3. Assess** (`2.3.4-Opportunity-Assessment/`) → Document and assess opportunities
**4. Decide** (`2.3.5-Idea-Validation/`) → Generate solutions and validate assumptions

**5. Deliver** (`2.1.4-PRD/`) → Write requirements and build

**6. Launch & Learn** (`2.1.2-OKR/` and `2.1.3-Roadmap/`) → Measure outcomes and iterate

## 🔧 Maintenance

**Living document principle:**
- Update when you use it: spot gaps → fix them
- Let git be the changelog: clear commit messages
- Prefer improvements over TODOs: make the change or log it in backlog

**Review cadence:**
- **Weekly**: Update initiatives and progress
- **Monthly**: Review frameworks and templates you touched
- **Quarterly**: Revisit company context (strategy, roadmap, OKRs)
- **Annually**: Cleanup folder structure and archive stale experiments

## 🤝 Contributing

Two ways to use this:

1. **Fork privately** (recommended for real company context)
2. **Contribute improvements** to public template (generic frameworks, guides, patterns)

When contributing:
1. Follow established folder and naming conventions
2. Keep examples generic (no proprietary information)
3. Use clear commit messages (what changed, why, for whom)
4. Share learnings: mention scenarios the guide handles
5. Respect placeholders: use brackets where teams plug in context
