P1
- BUG: search results for cards is wonky
  - search UOB doesn't show uob. but searching card, shows citi rewards.
- BUG: when searching, user cannot scroll down as keyboard is blocking
- search results should show by default heymax merchants first. once no heymax merchants are shown, call visa api automatically
- search results should replicate what the user is being suggested in searching screen
- searching letters will only show suggestions that have matching start of the letters
  - current issue: searching "gi" would show "iShopChangI"

P2
- NEW hypothesis: change recent searches to show recent merchants searched instead of search text
- NEW hypothesis: for you section recommendations are not relevant. update handpicked for you to popular searches will yield higher CTR, even to merchants that are not . in future we can amend to show popularity search of 'people like you' to optimise for conversion.
- when typing letters in search bar, only letters that were typed are in default-000 colour, the rest of suggested text are light grey
- remove see-all button from vouchers in searching screen

P3
- searching screen can include product recommendations in text format
