# Notes

notes for ops to note of
1. ingestion of csv from hsbc as soon as it comes in

sad flow scenarios for CS to note of
1. user received pre-rejection warning AND did not hit M1 minimum spend during M1 spend period
  1. transaction will automatically lapse
2. user received pre-rejection warning BUT received emails from us that she hit M1 minimum spend
  1. get user to reach out to HSBC, HSBC to reinstate in the next month's csv
  2. most likely user opted out from HSBC marketing consent
3. user received pre-rejection warning AND rewards lapsed -> contact support
  1. support need to tell user they cant get their rewards according to t&c
4. user M1 miles approved -> hsbc sends a clawback csv after a few months
  1. need to check if user cashed out
  2. clawback miles
  3. open question: need to get our t&c to cover that hsbc pays us first regardless and we will refund hsbc
