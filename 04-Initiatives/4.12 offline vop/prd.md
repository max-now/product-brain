# Card-Linked Acquisition & Retention Intelligence

**Enabling brands to acquire and retain the right customers through card transaction intelligence**

---

## Why Now

This initiative serves two strategic goals:

1. **Revenue diversification:** A new B2B channel that's better than current affiliate partnerships.

2. **Converting weekly active → transacting users:** Online affiliate merchant deals do encompass most users wallet share of weekly transactions. Building deals with offline merchants gives users more opportunities to earn miles on their day to day spend.

Three factors make this the right moment:

1. **Untapped asset:** We have rich card transaction data from VOP that we're not monetising. We know *exactly* who spends $500+/month on dining, who dines out 5x/week, and where they eat.

2. **Merchant pain is acute:** Offline F&B merchants face 25 - 30% commissions from Grab/Deliveroo with no customer data ownership. Instagram ads target interest, not intent - and provide no attribution.

3. **Market gap:** No card-linked personalised offers player exists in Singapore. Upside (US) has proven the model works, but there's no local equivalent.

**For Merchants:**
Offline F&B merchants struggle with:
- High customer acquisition costs (Instagram/Google ads target interest, not intent)
- No attribution (can't prove which marketing drove which sale)
- Retention blind spots (don't know who's lapsing until they're gone)
- Enrolment friction (QR codes, loyalty apps, sign-up forms)

**For HeyMax:**
We have VOP integration and rich card transaction data. This is an untapped B2B revenue channel.

## Vision

**Help any brand acquire and retain their ideal customers using card transaction intelligence.**


### Why Start with Restaurants
| Factor | Why F&B First |
| --- | --- |
| Transaction frequency | Weekly dining = fast feedback loops (vs monthly gym visits) |
| Rewards sensitivity | Diners respond to promos (Eatigo, OpenRice, credit card deals) |
| Decision speed | Owner-operators decide in days, not quarters |
| Data density | 77% of our dining transactions are lunch/dinner—rich cohorts |

**The end state:** Any offline brand like gyms, salons, clinics, retail can use our platform. F&B is the fastest path to proving the model.

---

## The Flywheel
**Our moat:** Card-rail attribution + cross-merchant data + meta-loyalty stacking. Users earn bank points + Max Miles + merchant offer in one transaction.

Our wedge: Card-rail attribution with zero consumer friction. Merchants get Upside-style performance pricing AND Oddle-style customer intelligence — without requiring users to do anything.

This business creates compounding value:

**Each transaction makes the next one more valuable:**
- More redemptions → richer behavioural data
- Richer data → better targeting → higher conversion
- Higher conversion → better merchant ROI → larger budgets
- More merchants → more offers → more user engagement → more transactions

## The Opportunity

### HeyMax Linked Card Users (Singapore F&B)

From our analysis of 24,156 active diners (last 90 days):

**Goal:** Validate demand — will merchants fund offers based on cohort data?
| Area | Target Users | Avg Monthly Spend | Total Monthly Spend |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Central Singapore | 2,134 | $792 | $1.69M |
| Orchard/Somerset | 624 | $506 | $316K |
| Marina Bay/CBD | 588 | $189 | $111K |
## Our Key Differentiator: Personalised Targeting

Beyond zero-integration convenience, our real value is **matching the right customers to the right merchants** using card transaction intelligence.

### How Personalised Offers Work

Merchants define their ideal customer profile. We match users and set reward tiers:
| Customer Type | Profile Match | Reward | Merchant Cost | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Acquisition** | High spender, never visited | 10 MPD | $0.25 | Win new high-value customers |
| **Retention** | Repeat visitor | 4 MPD | $0.10 | Keep them coming back |
| **Win-back** | Lapsed (90+ days) | 8 MPD | $0.20 | Re-engage churned customers |
**Example targeting:**
> "Show my 10 MPD offer to users who spend $300+/month on Japanese food within 2km but have never visited my restaurant. After their first visit, drop to 4 MPD for retention."

This is what competitors can't do - they have single-merchant data, we have wallet-level intelligence.


---

## Revenue Model & Projections

### How We Make Money

**Merchant-funded MPD rewards:** Merchants pay for the miles users earn. HeyMax sells miles at **SGD 2.5 cents per mile**.
| Reward Tier | MPD Rate | Merchant Cost (per $1 spent) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Acquisition (first visit) | 10 MPD | $0.25 |
| Retention (repeat visit) | 4 MPD | $0.10 |
| Win-back (lapsed) | 8 MPD | $0.20 |

**Example transaction:**
- User makes first visit, spends $30
- Earns 300 miles (10 MPD × $30 spend)
- Merchant pays HeyMax: 300 × $0.025 = **$7.50**

### Revenue Projections (User-Driven Model)

Revenue scales with **active users × adoption rate × redemption frequency**

**Base assumptions:**
- Avg spend per deal: $25
- Avg MPD rate: 6 MPD (blended acquisition + retention)
- Revenue per redemption: $25 × 6 × $0.025 = **$3.75**
| Phase | Monthly Active Users | Adoption Rate | Monthly Deals/User | Monthly Redemptions | Monthly Revenue |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **MVP** (SG) | 42,000 | 1% | 1 | 420 | **$1,575** |
| **Phase 1** (SG) | 50,000 | 5% | 1.5 | 1,800 | **$6,750** |
| **Phase 2** (SG) | 70,000 | 15% | 2 | 15,000 | **$56,250** |
**Note:** These are Singapore Phase 1-2 projections, not end-state. The real opportunity is building a merchant network that enables global expansion and future monetisation paths.

### Why This Is Better Than It Looks

**Network as the asset:** The merchant network has value beyond per-transaction revenue — it's a wedge for additional B2B products and global expansion.

**Key growth levers:**
1. **Adoption rate** — % of MAU who participate in at least one deal
2. **Redemption frequency** — deals redeemed per participating user per month
3. **MAU growth** — total monthly active users in platform
4. **Geographic expansion** — Singapore is Phase 1, not end-state

### Revenue Sensitivity
| If we increase... | From → To | Revenue Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Adoption rate | 15% → 25% | +67% |
| Redemptions/user | 1.5 → 2 | +33% |
| Avg spend | $25 → $35 | +40% |
### What Merchants Get: Campaign Reporting (Included)

Merchants receive performance reports as part of the deal — no subscription required:

**Per-Campaign Report:**
- Total redemptions and confirmed transactions
- New customers acquired vs. repeat visits
- Average transaction value of deal claimers
- Redemption rate (claimed vs. converted)
- Total miles funded / merchant cost

**Aggregated Insights (if volume permits):**
- Avg monthly dining spend of your deal claimers
- How your customers compare to area average
- Daypart breakdown (lunch vs. dinner performance)

This is **campaign analytics**, not a CRM product. It helps merchants decide whether to increase their MPD budget — which benefits us.

## What We've Already Learned

We ran CLO campaigns and voucher sales in 2024-2025. These results inform our experiment design:
| Campaign | MPD | Txns | Avg Spend | Txns/Week | Key Learning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SKOSH (10 MPD) | 10 | 127 | $28.19 | ~14 | Lower-ticket everyday restaurants drive highest frequency |
| 8 Korean BBQ (10 MPD) | 10 | 66 | $167.23 | ~4 | Higher ticket = fewer but larger transactions |
| Fi Woodfire Thai (10 MPD) | 10 | 31 | $123.24 | ~4 | Novelty tapered off after 7 weeks |
| Japanese Rail Cafe (5 MPD) | 5 | 315 | $55.16 | ~14 | Uptick but not everyday food — limited repeat |
| Frying Fish Club (Vouchers) | 10 | 485 net | - | - |  |
**Key takeaway:** Everyday, lower-ticket restaurants drive the most habitual engagement. 10 MPD works but is expensive (~20% of Restaurants GMV). 6 MPD is the sweet spot for sustainability.

---

## What We're Building

Each experiment unlocks a specific **scaling lever**. The sequence is designed so each experiment produces the data or proof needed for the next.

```
Exp 0 (Do offers work?)
  └─► Exp 1 (Will merchants pay?)
       └─► Exp 2 (Does merchant funding hold?)
            ├─► Exp 3 (Does personalisation improve efficiency?)
            └─► Exp 4 (Can we shift demand to off-peak?)
                 └─► Scale Phase (all levers activated)
```

---

### Experiment 0: Prove User Behaviour Change (Weeks 1-4)

**Hypothesis:** Card-linked offers at 6 MPD will drive measurable incremental lunch visits to independent restaurants in the CBD.

**Why first:** Before pitching merchants, we need proof that offers change behaviour. HeyMax self-funds this test.

**Unlocks:** Proven redemption rate + lift data → credible merchant pitch (Exp 1)

**Setup:**
- **Where:** CBD area (lat 1.28, lng 103.84) — highest user density (2,134 users, $1.69M/month)
- **Which restaurants:** 2-3 independents with <200 txns in 90 days (need help filling seats, owner-operators decide fast)
- **When:** Full lunch window 11am-2pm (not off-peak — tests one clean hypothesis)
- **Offer:** Flat 6 MPD, $10 min spend, 1 redemption/day/user, max 180 miles/redemption
- **Funding:** HeyMax self-funded (50,000 miles budget = $SGD 1,000)
- **Opt-in:** In-app claim button — no email blast, no campaign page
- **Control group:** 50/50 matched split (matched on spend tier, frequency, recency)
- **Data captured:** Transaction time distribution for every redemption (baseline for Exp 4)

**Measurement:**
- Control vs exposed group (half see offer, half don't)
- Track: claim rate, redemption rate, incremental visit rate, repeat visits within 30 days

**Success criteria:**
| Metric | Target | What It Proves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Offer claim rate | >15% | Users notice and engage with offers |
| Offer redemption rate | >5% | Users follow through and transact |
| Incremental lift vs control | >10% | Offers drive new visits |
| Repeat visit rate (30 days) | >20% | Users return after first redemption |
| Avg transaction value | >= $20-50 | Quality conversions, not gaming |

**Decision:** If successful → proceed to Experiment 1 with confidence. If not → iterate on offer structure, restaurant selection, or abandon.

### Experiment 1: Prove Merchants Will Fund (Weeks 5-7)

**Hypothesis:** F&B merchants will commit to fund performance-based offers when shown specific cohort data and proven redemption rates.

**Unlocks:** Merchant willingness to pay → merchant-funded offers (Exp 2) + validates pricing

**Setup (Zero Engineering):**
- BD pitches 10 F&B merchants using:
  - PDF cohort reports showing "X users with high dining spend within 1km but haven't visited you" (frame as intent signal)
  - Experiment 0 results (proven redemption rates and lift)
  - Performance-based pricing (they only pay when users transact)
- **Two merchant segments to pitch:**
  - **Independents (<200 txns):** "We can drive X more lunch customers per week" (full lunch window)
  - **Bigger brands (500+ txns):** "We can fill your off-peak tables" (preview Exp 4 value prop)
- **Flat rate offer:** 6 MPD for all users (same as Experiment 0)
- **Pricing sensitivity:** Test willingness to pay at different MPD rates if merchants push back. HeyMax can subsidize during validation phase.

**Success criteria:**
| Metric | Target | What It Proves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Merchants pitched | 10 | Outreach capacity |
| LOIs / commitments | 3+ | Demand exists |
| Avg offer budget committed | >$500/merchant | Willingness to pay |
| Objections documented | All | Informs pricing strategy |
| Independent vs bigger brand interest | Tracked separately | Which segment to scale first |

**Decision:** If 3+ commitments → launch merchant-funded offers. If <3 → revise pitch, adjust pricing, or abandon.

---

### Experiment 2: Prove Merchant-Funded Offers Work (Weeks 8-12)

**Hypothesis:** Merchant-funded offers will achieve similar performance to HeyMax-funded offers (Experiment 0).

**Unlocks:** Sustainable unit economics → can scale without HeyMax subsidising every deal

**Setup:**
- Launch with 3-5 committed merchants from Experiment 1
- **Flat rate offer:** 6 MPD for all users
- Merchants fund the MPD, not HeyMax

**Success criteria:**
| Metric | Target | What It Proves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Offer redemption rate | >5% | Performance holds with merchant funding |
| Merchant satisfaction | >60% want to continue | Sustainable economics |
| Incremental lift vs control | >10% | Offers still drive behaviour change |

**Decision:** If successful → proceed to Experiments 3 and 4 in parallel. If merchant satisfaction is low → iterate pricing.

---

### Experiment 3: Prove Personalisation Works (Weeks 13-17)

**Hypothesis:** Tiered rewards based on customer type (new/repeat/lapsed/churned) will be more cost-efficient than flat rewards.

**Unlocks:** Lower CAC per new customer → better merchant ROI → higher budgets and retention

**Setup:**
- Use existing merchants from Experiment 2
- A/B test:
  - **Control:** Flat 6 MPD for everyone
  - **Test:** Tiered rewards by segment:
    - New to merchant: 10 MPD
    - Repeat visitor: 4 MPD
    - Lapsed (90+ days): 8 MPD
    - Churned (180+ days): 10 MPD

**Success criteria:**
| Metric | Target | What It Proves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| New customer acquisition cost | 20% lower than flat | Tiered is more efficient |
| Total MPD spend | Same or lower vs flat | Better economics for merchants |
| Redemption rates maintained | Within 10% of flat | Users still engage |

**Decision:** If successful → build personalisation into platform. If no difference → keep flat offers (simpler).

---

### Experiment 4: Prove Off-Peak Demand Shifting (Weeks 13-17, parallel with Exp 3)

**Hypothesis:** Higher MPD during off-peak hours will shift user transactions away from peak times, filling empty tables for bigger brands.

**Unlocks:** Opens the bigger brand segment (chains, popular restaurants) who don't need help at peak → much larger TAM

**Why separate from Exp 0:** Exp 0 targets independents who need more customers at all hours. Bigger brands (PS Cafe, popular chains) are already full at 12-1pm — they need off-peak help. Testing both in one experiment muddies results.

**Uses Exp 0 baseline:** Exp 0 captures natural transaction time distribution at 11am-2pm. Exp 4 tests whether we can shift that distribution with differential pricing.

**Setup:**
- **Target:** 2-3 bigger brands (500+ txns/90d) that have clear peak-hour congestion
- **Offer structure:**
  - Off-peak (11am-12pm, 2pm-3pm): 8-10 MPD (higher reward)
  - Peak (12pm-2pm): 4 MPD (lower reward)
- **Measurement:** Compare redemption time distribution vs Exp 0 baseline

**Success criteria:**
| Metric | Target | What It Proves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Off-peak redemption shift | >15% increase vs Exp 0 baseline | Users respond to higher off-peak MPD |
| Peak hour redemptions | Decrease or stay flat | Not cannibalising peak demand |
| Merchant satisfaction | >70% find it valuable | Worth the added complexity |
| Total redemptions | Maintained or increased | Doesn't reduce overall engagement |

**Decision:** If successful → build daypart pricing into platform. If not → keep time-agnostic offers.

## Scaling Strategy: Experiments → Levers → Growth

Each experiment validates a specific **scaling lever**. Here's how they compound:

### The Five Scaling Levers

| Lever | Validated By | What It Enables | Scale Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Offers drive visits** | Exp 0 | Credible merchant pitch; proof the model works | Foundation — nothing scales without this |
| **2. Merchants will pay** | Exp 1 + 2 | Sustainable revenue; no HeyMax subsidy | Revenue — each merchant = recurring income |
| **3. Personalisation** | Exp 3 | Lower CAC, higher merchant ROI → bigger budgets | Efficiency — same spend, better results |
| **4. Daypart targeting** | Exp 4 | Unlocks bigger brands (chains, popular spots) | TAM expansion — from independents to chains |
| **5. Geo expansion** | Post-experiments | Replicate CBD playbook in other areas | Volume — multiply everything by N areas |

### Scaling Phases

**Phase 1: Deepen CBD (Months 5-6)**

After experiments prove the model:
- Expand to 10-15 merchants in CBD (mix of independents + bigger brands)
- Activate personalisation (Exp 3 results) for tiered pricing
- Activate daypart pricing (Exp 4 results) for bigger brands
- Build basic merchant reporting dashboard (replace manual PDF reports)

**Key metric:** 10+ active merchants, >1,000 monthly redemptions in CBD alone

**Phase 2: Replicate Geography (Months 6-9)**

The CBD playbook is repeatable. Each new area follows the same pattern:
1. Pull BigQuery cohort data for the area (we already have Orchard, Marina Bay, Woodlands, Tampines)
2. Identify top independent restaurants (<200 txns)
3. BD pitches with CBD proof points + area-specific cohort data
4. Launch with same offer structure (6 MPD, full lunch)

**Priority areas (from cohort data):**
| Area | Target Users | Monthly Spend | Why Next |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Orchard/Somerset | 624 | $316K | Second-highest user density + high-value dining |
| Marina Bay/CBD East | 588 | $111K | Adjacent to CBD, overlapping office worker base |
| Bugis/Kampong Glam | 538 | $134K | Dense F&B district, strong independent scene |
| Tampines | 315 | $66K | Suburban test — different user behaviour |

**Key metric:** 3+ areas live, 30+ merchants total, >5,000 monthly redemptions

**Phase 3: Product + Channel Expansion (Months 9-12)**

With proven multi-area traction:
- **Merchant self-serve portal:** Merchants set their own offer rules, view performance
- **Dinner expansion:** Extend beyond lunch (dinner = 37% of dining, 50% higher transaction values)
- **Category expansion:** Gyms, salons, clinics, retail (same card-linked model, different verticals)
- **Geo-proximity triggers:** Real-time "you're near a deal" push notifications

**Key metric:** Monthly revenue >$50K, merchant retention >70%

### How Levers Compound

```
                        Revenue = Merchants × Users × Redemptions × Avg Spend × MPD Rate × $0.025

Lever 1 (Offers work)  ──────────────────────────────── Redemptions ↑
Lever 2 (Merchants pay) ── Merchants ↑ ─────────────────────────────
Lever 3 (Personalisation) ──────────────────────────────── Efficiency ↑ (lower cost per acquisition)
Lever 4 (Daypart)       ── Merchants ↑ (bigger brands) ── Redemptions ↑ (off-peak volume)
Lever 5 (Geo expansion) ── Merchants ↑ ── Users ↑ ──── Redemptions ↑
```

Each lever multiplies the others. A 2x increase in merchants × 2x increase in areas × 1.5x from personalisation = **6x revenue** from the same underlying model.

## User Growth: Merchant-Funded Acquisition

### The Concept: Restaurants as User Acquisition
| Step | What Happens | Who Pays |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | User sees "Earn miles here" at restaurant (table tent, receipt, server mention) | Restaurant provides visibility |
| 2 | User downloads HeyMax app, links card | — |
| 3 | User claims welcome deal, completes transaction | HeyMax funds first X miles |
| 4 | User becomes ongoing HeyMax user with deals at this + other merchants | Merchant funds ongoing rewards |
This initiative primarily drives **engagement** (existing users transact more). But it can also address **user acquisition** by turning restaurants into a distribution channel.

### Why Restaurants Would Participate

- They get a loyalty/rewards layer without building one
- No cost until user transacts
- Drives repeat visits from proven spenders
- Differentiates them from competitors

### The Economics

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| HeyMax funds first welcome bonus | 500 miles (~$12.50) |
| User does 2 redemptions/month | $7.50/month revenue |
| Payback period | ~2 months |

### When to Introduce This

**Not MVP.** Focus first on proving the core model works (existing users redeem offers). Once we have:
- 5+ merchants live
- Proven redemption rates
- Happy merchants asking "how do I get more customers?"

Then pilot merchant-funded acquisition with 1-2 high-traffic restaurants.

---

## Value Proposition

### For Merchants

**The pitch:**
> "We have X cardholders within 1km who spend $Y/month on dining but have never visited you. We'll put your offer in front of them. You fund the reward, you only pay when they transact."

**Why this works:**
- **Intent signals:** We show spending behaviour on linked Visa cards — a strong intent signal for targeting (not complete wallet visibility, but proven dining patterns)
- **Specificity:** Not "food lovers" but "$300+/mo Japanese diners within 1km"
- **Performance-aligned:** Pay when they transact, not for impressions
- **Zero effort:** No app, no POS integration, no loyalty setup
- **Proven attribution:** VOP closes the loop definitively
- **Cross-merchant benchmarking:** "Your customers spend $180/mo on dining. Area average is $260." Single-merchant CRMs can't do this.
- **Instant activation:** Merchant goes live in one call — no POS integration, no hardware, no consumer app.

### For Users

- Earn MPD at offline merchants (new earning pathway)
- Stacks with existing card rewards (meta-loyalty)
- No extra steps — pay with linked card, earn automatically

---

## Why We Win
| Capability | Competitors | HeyMax |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Targeting precision** | Interest-based (Instagram) or single-merchant (Oddle) | **Wallet-level intent** ("$300+/mo Japanese diners who haven't visited you") |
| **Personalised rewards** | Flat offers for everyone | **Tiered by customer value** (10 MPD acquire, 4 MPD retain) |
| **Cross-merchant intelligence** | Single merchant view | **Wallet visibility + benchmarking** ("Your customers spend $180/mo. Area avg is $260.") |
| **Attribution** | Receipt scans (Upside), QR codes (Oddle) | **VOP card-rail** (definitive) |
| **Consumer friction** | App activation required | **Zero** (pay with linked card) |
| **Time to launch** | Weeks (POS integration) | **One call** (no hardware) |

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cohort sizes too small for merchants | Low merchant interest | Start with highest-density areas (Central, Orchard) |
| Low offer redemption | Poor unit economics | Test reward levels; use daypart targeting; limit deal availability to create scarcity |
| Partial wallet (Visa only) | Merchants question data completeness | Be upfront: frame as "intent signal" not complete wallet; prove incrementality through results |
| Merchants unwilling to pay full rate | Slow adoption | Subsidize during validation; test different MPD rates; document objections to inform pricing |
| --- | --- | --- |

---

## Success Metrics

| Phase | Metric | Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MVP | Merchant commitments | 3+ |
| Phase 1 | Redemption rate | >5% |
| Phase 1 | Incremental lift vs control | >10% |
| Phase 1 | Merchant renewal intent | >60% |
| Scale | Monthly revenue | >$50K |
| Scale | Merchant retention | >70% |

## What This Initiative IS and IS NOT

**IS:**
