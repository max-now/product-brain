# Card-Linked Acquisition & Retention Intelligence

**Enabling brands to acquire and retain the right customers through card transaction intelligence**

---

## Why Now

This initiative serves two strategic goals:

1. **Revenue diversification:** A new B2B channel that's better than current affiliate partnerships.

2. **Converting weekly active → transacting users:** Online affiliate merchant deals do encompass most users wallet share of weekly transactions. Building deals with offline merchants gives users more opportunities to earn miles on their day to day spend.

Three factors make this the right moment:

1. **Untapped asset:** We have rich card transaction data from VOP that we're not monetising. We know *exactly* who spends $500+/month on dining, who dines out 5x/week, and where they eat.

2. **Merchant pain is acute:** Offline F&B merchants face 25** - 30% commissions from Grab/Deliveroo with no customer data ownership. Instagram ads target interest, not intent -** and provide no attribution.

3. **Market gap:** No card-linked personalised offers player exists in Singapore. Upside (US) has proven the model works, but there's no local equivalent.

**For Merchants:**
Offline F&B merchants struggle with:
- High customer acquisition costs (Instagram/Google ads target interest, not intent)
- No attribution (can't prove which marketing drove which sale)
- Retention blind spots (don't know who's lapsing until they're gone)
- Enrolment friction (QR codes, loyalty apps, sign-up forms)

**For HeyMax:**
We have VOP integration and rich card transaction data. This is an untapped B2B revenue channel.

## Vision

**Help any brand acquire and retain their ideal customers using card transaction intelligence.**


### Why Start with Restaurants
| Factor | Why F&B First |
| --- | --- |
| Transaction frequency | Weekly dining = fast feedback loops (vs monthly gym visits) |
| Rewards sensitivity | Diners respond to promos (Eatigo, OpenRice, credit card deals) |
| Decision speed | Owner-operators decide in days, not quarters |
| Data density | 77% of our dining transactions are lunch/dinner—rich cohorts |

**The end state:** Any offline brand like gyms, salons, clinics, retail can use our platform. F&B is the fastest path to proving the model.

---

## The Flywheel
**Our moat:** Card-rail attribution + cross-merchant data + meta-loyalty stacking. Users earn bank points + Max Miles + merchant offer in one transaction.

**Our wedge: **Card-rail attribution with zero consumer friction. Merchants get Upside-style performance pricing AND Oddle-style customer intelligence — without requiring users to do anything.

This business creates compounding value:

**Each transaction makes the next one more valuable:**
- More redemptions → richer behavioural data
- Richer data → better targeting → higher conversion
- Higher conversion → better merchant ROI → larger budgets
- More merchants → more offers → more user engagement → more transactions

## The Opportunity

### HeyMax Linked Card Users (Singapore F&B)

From our analysis of 24,156 active diners (last 90 days):

**Goal:** Validate demand — will merchants fund offers based on cohort data?
| Area | Target Users | Avg Monthly Spend | Total Monthly Spend |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Central Singapore | 2,134 | $792 | $1.69M |
| Orchard/Somerset | 624 | $506 | $316K |
| Marina Bay/CBD | 588 | $189 | $111K |
## Our Key Differentiator: Personalised Targeting

Beyond zero-integration convenience, our real value is **matching the right customers to the right merchants** using card transaction intelligence.

### How Personalised Offers Work

Merchants define their ideal customer profile. We match users and set reward tiers:
| Customer Type | Profile Match | Reward | Merchant Cost | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Acquisition** | High spender, never visited | 10 MPD | $0.25 | Win new high-value customers |
| **Retention** | Repeat visitor | 4 MPD | $0.10 | Keep them coming back |
| **Win-back** | Lapsed (90+ days) | 8 MPD | $0.20 | Re-engage churned customers |
**Example targeting:**
> "Show my 10 MPD offer to users who spend $300+/month on Japanese food within 2km but have never visited my restaurant. After their first visit, drop to 4 MPD for retention."

This is what competitors can't do - they have single-merchant data, we have wallet-level intelligence.


---

## Revenue Model & Projections

### How We Make Money

**Merchant-funded MPD rewards:** Merchants pay for the miles users earn. HeyMax sells miles at **SGD 2.5 cents per mile**.
| Reward Tier | MPD Rate | Merchant Cost (per $1 spent) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Acquisition (first visit) | 10 MPD | $0.25 |
| Retention (repeat visit) | 4 MPD | $0.10 |
| Win-back (lapsed) | 8 MPD | $0.20 |

**Example transaction:**
- User makes first visit, spends $30
- Earns 300 miles (10 MPD × $30 spend)
- Merchant pays HeyMax: 300 × $0.025 = **$7.50**

### Revenue Projections (User-Driven Model)

Revenue scales with **active users × adoption rate × redemption frequency**

**Base assumptions:**
- Avg spend per deal: $25
- Avg MPD rate: 6 MPD (blended acquisition + retention)
- Revenue per redemption: $25 × 6 × $0.025 = **$3.75**
| Phase | Monthly Active Users | Adoption Rate | Monthly Deals/User | Monthly Redemptions | Monthly Revenue |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **MVP** (SG) | 42,000 | 1% | 1 | 420 | **$1,575** |
| **Phase 1** (SG) | 50,000 | 5% | 1.5 | 1,800 | **$6,750** |
| **Phase 2** (SG) | 70,000 | 15% | 2 | 15,000 | **$56,250** |
**Note:** These are Singapore Phase 1-2 projections, not end-state. The real opportunity is building a merchant network that enables global expansion and future monetisation paths.

### Why This Is Better Than It Looks

**Network as the asset:** The merchant network has value beyond per-transaction revenue — it's a wedge for additional B2B products and global expansion.

**Key growth levers:**
1. **Adoption rate** — % of MAU who participate in at least one deal
2. **Redemption frequency** — deals redeemed per participating user per month
3. **MAU growth** — total monthly active users in platform
4. **Geographic expansion** — Singapore is Phase 1, not end-state

### Revenue Sensitivity
| If we increase... | From → To | Revenue Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Adoption rate | 15% → 25% | +67% |
| Redemptions/user | 1.5 → 2 | +33% |
| Avg spend | $25 → $35 | +40% |
### What Merchants Get: Campaign Reporting (Included)

Merchants receive performance reports as part of the deal — no subscription required:

**Per-Campaign Report:**
- Total redemptions and confirmed transactions
- New customers acquired vs. repeat visits
- Average transaction value of deal claimers
- Redemption rate (claimed vs. converted)
- Total miles funded / merchant cost

**Aggregated Insights (if volume permits):**
- Avg monthly dining spend of your deal claimers
- How your customers compare to area average
- Daypart breakdown (lunch vs. dinner performance)

This is **campaign analytics**, not a CRM product. It helps merchants decide whether to increase their MPD budget — which benefits us.

## What We're Building

### Experiment 0: Prove User Behaviour Change (Weeks 1-4)

**Hypothesis:** Card-linked offers will drive measurable incremental visits to participating merchants.

**Why first:** Before pitching merchants, we need to know if offers actually work. HeyMax self-funds the first test.

**Setup:**
- Select 2-3 restaurants in CBD/Central (highest user density)
- HeyMax funds the MPD rewards (not merchant-funded yet)
- **Flat rate offer:** 6 MPD for all users (keep it simple)
- No segmentation yet (new vs repeat)

**Measurement:**
- Control vs exposed group (half see offer, half don't)
- Track: redemption rate, incremental visit rate, repeat visits within 30 days

**Success criteria:**
| Metric | Target | What It Proves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Offer redemption rate | >5% | Users engage with offers |
| Incremental lift vs control | >10% | Offers drive new visits |
| Repeat visit rate (30 days) | >20% | Users return after first redemption |
**Decision:** If successful → proceed to Experiment 1 with confidence. If not → iterate on offer structure or abandon.

---

### Experiment 1: Prove Merchants Will Fund (Weeks 5-7)

**Hypothesis:** F&B merchants will commit to fund performance-based offers when shown specific cohort data and proven redemption rates.

**Setup (Zero Engineering):**
- BD pitches 10 F&B merchants using:
  - PDF cohort reports showing "X users with high dining spend within 1km but haven't visited you" (frame as intent signal)
  - Experiment 0 results (proven redemption rates and lift)
  - Performance-based pricing (they only pay when users transact)
- **Flat rate offer:** 6 MPD for all users (same as Experiment 0)
- **Pricing sensitivity:** Test willingness to pay at different MPD rates if merchants push back. HeyMax can subsidize during validation phase.

**Success criteria:**
| Metric | Target | What It Proves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Merchants pitched | 10 | Outreach capacity |
| LOIs / commitments | 3+ | Demand exists |
| Avg offer budget committed | >$500/merchant | Willingness to pay |
| Objections documented | All | Informs pricing strategy |

**Decision:** If 3+ commitments → launch merchant-funded offers. If <3 → revise pitch, adjust pricing, or abandon.

---

### Experiment 2: Prove Merchant-Funded Offers Work (Weeks 8-12)

**Hypothesis:** Merchant-funded offers will achieve similar performance to HeyMax-funded offers (Experiment 0).

**Setup:**
- Launch with 3-5 committed merchants from Experiment 1
- **Flat rate offer:** 6 MPD for all users
- Merchants fund the MPD, not HeyMax

**Success criteria:**
| Metric | Target | What It Proves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Offer redemption rate | >5% | Performance holds with merchant funding |
| Merchant satisfaction | >60% want to continue | Sustainable economics |
| Incremental lift vs control | >10% | Offers still drive behaviour change |

**Decision:** If successful → proceed to Experiment 3 (personalization). If merchant satisfaction is low → iterate pricing.

---

### Experiment 3: Prove Personalisation Works (Weeks 13-17)

**Hypothesis:** Tiered rewards based on customer type (new/repeat/lapsed/churned) will be more cost-efficient than flat rewards.

**Setup:**
- Use existing merchants from Experiment 2
- A/B test:
  - **Control:** Flat 6 MPD for everyone
  - **Test:** Tiered rewards by segment:
    - New to merchant: 10 MPD
    - Repeat visitor: 4 MPD
    - Lapsed (90+ days): 8 MPD
    - Churned (180+ days): 10 MPD

**Success criteria:**
| Metric | Target | What It Proves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| New customer acquisition cost | 20% lower than flat | Tiered is more efficient |
| Total MPD spend | Same or lower vs flat | Better economics for merchants |
| Redemption rates maintained | Within 10% of flat | Users still engage |

**Decision:** If successful → build personalisation into platform. If no difference → keep flat offers (simpler).

---

### Scale Phase (Months 5-6)

If all experiments succeed:
- Expand to 15-20 merchants per priority area
- Add geo-proximity targeting (show offers when user is near merchant)
- Build merchant self-serve portal (based on personalisation results)
- Expand beyond F&B (gyms, salons, services)

---

## User Growth: Merchant-Funded Acquisition

### The Concept: Restaurants as User Acquisition
| Step | What Happens | Who Pays |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | User sees "Earn miles here" at restaurant (table tent, receipt, server mention) | Restaurant provides visibility |
| 2 | User downloads HeyMax app, links card | — |
| 3 | User claims welcome deal, completes transaction | HeyMax funds first X miles |
| 4 | User becomes ongoing HeyMax user with deals at this + other merchants | Merchant funds ongoing rewards |
This initiative primarily drives **engagement** (existing users transact more). But it can also address **user acquisition** by turning restaurants into a distribution channel.

### Why Restaurants Would Participate

- They get a loyalty/rewards layer without building one
- No cost until user transacts
- Drives repeat visits from proven spenders
- Differentiates them from competitors

### The Economics

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| HeyMax funds first welcome bonus | 500 miles (~$12.50) |
| User does 2 redemptions/month | $7.50/month revenue |
| Payback period | ~2 months |

### When to Introduce This

**Not MVP.** Focus first on proving the core model works (existing users redeem offers). Once we have:
- 5+ merchants live
- Proven redemption rates
- Happy merchants asking "how do I get more customers?"

Then pilot merchant-funded acquisition with 1-2 high-traffic restaurants.

---

## Value Proposition

### For Merchants

**The pitch:**
> "We have X cardholders within 1km who spend $Y/month on dining but have never visited you. We'll put your offer in front of them. You fund the reward, you only pay when they transact."

**Why this works:**
- **Intent signals:** We show spending behaviour on linked Visa cards — a strong intent signal for targeting (not complete wallet visibility, but proven dining patterns)
- **Specificity:** Not "food lovers" but "$300+/mo Japanese diners within 1km"
- **Performance-aligned:** Pay when they transact, not for impressions
- **Zero effort:** No app, no POS integration, no loyalty setup
- **Proven attribution:** VOP closes the loop definitively
- **Cross-merchant benchmarking:** "Your customers spend $180/mo on dining. Area average is $260." Single-merchant CRMs can't do this.
- **Instant activation:** Merchant goes live in one call — no POS integration, no hardware, no consumer app.

### For Users

- Earn MPD at offline merchants (new earning pathway)
- Stacks with existing card rewards (meta-loyalty)
- No extra steps — pay with linked card, earn automatically

---

## Why We Win
| Capability | Competitors | HeyMax |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Targeting precision** | Interest-based (Instagram) or single-merchant (Oddle) | **Wallet-level intent** ("$300+/mo Japanese diners who haven't visited you") |
| **Personalised rewards** | Flat offers for everyone | **Tiered by customer value** (10 MPD acquire, 4 MPD retain) |
| **Cross-merchant intelligence** | Single merchant view | **Wallet visibility + benchmarking** ("Your customers spend $180/mo. Area avg is $260.") |
| **Attribution** | Receipt scans (Upside), QR codes (Oddle) | **VOP card-rail** (definitive) |
| **Consumer friction** | App activation required | **Zero** (pay with linked card) |
| **Time to launch** | Weeks (POS integration) | **One call** (no hardware) |

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cohort sizes too small for merchants | Low merchant interest | Start with highest-density areas (Central, Orchard) |
| Low offer redemption | Poor unit economics | Test reward levels; use daypart targeting; limit deal availability to create scarcity |
| Partial wallet (Visa only) | Merchants question data completeness | Be upfront: frame as "intent signal" not complete wallet; prove incrementality through results |
| Merchants unwilling to pay full rate | Slow adoption | Subsidize during validation; test different MPD rates; document objections to inform pricing |
| --- | --- | --- |

---

## Success Metrics

| Phase | Metric | Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MVP | Merchant commitments | 3+ |
| Phase 1 | Redemption rate | >5% |
| Phase 1 | Incremental lift vs control | >10% |
| Phase 1 | Merchant renewal intent | >60% |
| Scale | Monthly revenue | >$50K |
| Scale | Merchant retention | >70% |

## What This Initiative IS and IS NOT

**IS:**
- A new B2B revenue channel with better unit economics than most current partnerships
- A path to convert active users into transacting users (lower friction than online affiliates)
- Validation-first: prove demand before building product
- A wedge to build merchant network for future monetization
- A potential user acquisition channel (merchants as distribution) — post-MVP

**IS NOT:**
- A CRM/SaaS product (we don't see enough of their customers to be a CRM)
- A dashboard-first product (prove value → build UI)
- Replacing online merchant partnerships
- Enterprise sales (stay nimble, target independents first)
- End-state revenue — Singapore is Phase 1, global expansion is the opportunity
