## 3. Timing & Daypart Insights

⚠️ **Note:** All timing data converted to Singapore Time (UTC+8).

### Transaction Volume by daypart
| Day | % of Txns | Avg Txn Value | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Lunch (10am-2pm)** | **40%** | $9 - 78 | Fast casual, food courts, office lunch |
| **Dinner (5-10pm)** | **37%** | $12 - 118 | Sit-down restaurants, premium dining |
| Breakfast (6-9am) | 10% | $6 - 63 | Coffee shops, breakfast spots |
| Other times | 13% | Varies | Late night, snacks |

### 🎯 Strategic Implication: Dual-Daypart Strategy Required

**Lunch AND dinner are equally important:**
- Combined = 77% of all dining transactions
- Dinner has 30-55% higher transaction values
- Different merchant types for each daypart

### Peak Hours (Singapore Time)

**Lunch Peak:**
- 12pm: 12.0% of all transactions
- 1pm: 10.1%
- 11am: 9.6%

**Dinner Peak:**
- 7pm: 9.6% of all transactions
- 6pm: 8.4%
- 8pm: 7.5%

### Transaction Value Premium by daypart
| Spend Tier | Avg Lunch | Avg Dinner | Dinner Premium |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Light Frequent | $9.16 | $11.98 | +31% |
| Medium ($100-200) | $23.21 | $34.98 | +51% |
| Regular ($200-500) | $28.72 | $44.47 | +55% |
| Heavy ($500+) | $77.70 | $117.62 | +51% |
**Key Insight:** Dinner transactions are 30-55% higher value than lunch — better ROI per redemption despite potentially lower conversion rates.

## 4. Transaction Value Analysis (Avg vs Median)

### Why Median Matters for Deal Structuring
| Spend Tier | Users | Avg Txn | Median Txn | P25 | P75 | Gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Heavy ($500+) | 5,195 | **$55** | **$12** | $6 | $31 | **5x** |
| Regular ($200-500) | 9,759 | **$23** | **$9.30** | $5 | $20 | 2.5x |
| Medium ($100-200) | 6,653 | **$18** | **$8.10** | $4 | $17 | 2.2x |
| Light Frequent | 2,548 | **$9** | **$5.70** | $3 | $10 | 1.6x |

**Deal Structuring Insight:**
- Use **median values** for minimum spend thresholds
- Heavy Spenders: Most transactions are $6 - $31, not $55
- Structure deals to capture 50%+ of typical transactions

## 6. Merchant Deal Frameworks

### Framework 1: Lunch Volume Play

**Target:** Regular & Medium Spenders (16,414 users)

**Geography:** Central, Orchard, Marina Bay CBD

**Timing:** 11am-2pm SGT

**Deal Structure:**
- Min Spend: $10 (median lunch = $9)
- MPD Rate: 50-100 MPD (~$0.50-1.00)
- Best for: Fast casual, food courts, coffee + lunch

**Merchant Pitch:**
> "16,000+ users dine out for lunch every day. 40% of their dining happens 11am-2pm. We'll drive them to your restaurant during lunch rush for $0.50-1 per customer."

**Volume Projection:**
- 16,414 users × 13 avg lunch txns/90d = 213K potential transactions
- 1% conversion = 2,130 redemptions × $10 avg = $21,300 revenue
- Merchant cost: $1,065-$2,130 (5-10% cost-to-revenue)

---

### Framework 2: Dinner Premium Play

**Target:** All spend tiers (24,156 users) — dinner is 37% of volume

**Geography:** Central, Marina Bay, River Valley

**Timing:** 6pm-9pm SGT

**Deal Structure:**
- Min Spend: $25-35 (median dinner = $30-45)
- MPD Rate: 150-250 MPD (~$1.50-2.50)
- Best for: Sit-down restaurants, Japanese/Korean, Italian

**Merchant Pitch:**
> "Dinner transactions are 50% higher value than lunch ($45 vs $29 avg). 37% of dining happens 6-9pm. We'll drive high-value dinner customers to your restaurant."

**Volume Projection:**
- 24,156 users × 13 avg dinner txns/90d = 314K potential transactions
- 2% conversion = 6,280 redemptions × $35 avg = $220K revenue
- Merchant cost: $9,420-$15,700 (4-7% cost-to-revenue)

**Why This Works:**
- Dinner is 37% of volume (NOT 2% as shown in incorrect UTC analysis)
- 50% higher transaction values → better merchant ROI
- Targets social dining occasions (date nights, family dinners)

---

### Framework 3: All-Day Deals (Chains & Coffee)

**Target:** All segments (24,156 users)

**Timing:** No restrictions

**Best For:** Chains, hawker centers, coffee shops

**Deal Structure:**
- Min Spend: $8
- MPD Rate: 40-60 MPD (~$0.40-0.60)

**Merchant Pitch:**
> "No time restrictions — 75% of dining happens during lunch/dinner. Capture both daypart with one deal."

---

### Framework 4: Delivery Displacement (Tampines Case Study)

**Target:** 152 Tampines users (80 are high spenders)

**Insight:** Deliveroo dominates ($30 avg order)

**Deal Structure:**
- Min Spend: $20-30 (match Deliveroo avg)
- MPD Rate: 150-200 MPD (~$1.50-2.00)
- Timing: 11:30am-1pm (pre-delivery window)

**Merchant Pitch:**
> "152 users in Tampines spend $286/mo on lunch—most via Deliveroo ($30 avg order). We can drive them to walk-in with MPD rewards that beat delivery fees."

**Merchant Benefit:** Save Deliveroo commission (30%) on converted customers

---

## 7. Recommended Pilot Program

### Week 1-2: Dual-Daypart Launch

**Lunch Pilot (11am-2pm SGT)**
- Location: Central Singapore (2,134 users)
- Partners: 3 fast-casual restaurants
- Deal: $10 min, 80 MPD
- Target cohort: 317 frequent Central lunch users
- Success metric: >10% redemption rate

**Dinner Pilot (6pm-9pm SGT)**
- Location: Central/Marina Bay
- Partners: 2-3 sit-down restaurants
- Deal: $30 min, 200 MPD
- Target: Heavy/Regular spenders (avg $45-118 dinner)
- Success metric: >5% redemption rate

**Hypothesis to Test:**
- Dinner will have lower redemption rate (5% vs 10% lunch)
- BUT higher transaction values ($45 vs $29)
- Better merchant ROI (50% higher revenue per customer)

---

## 8. Merchant Pitch Templates

**Supporting Data:**
- Geographic: Central Singapore (~1km radius)
- User count: 2,134 target users

---

### Template 3: Lapsed Customer Win-Back

**Example Output:**
- 127 lapsed customers identified
- Last visit: 90-180 days ago
- Still actively dining (avg 18 txns/90d at competitors)
- Average spend when they were customers: $42/txn

## 12. Next Steps & Action Items

### Immediate (Week 1)

1. **Validate Top 3 Markets**
  - Central Singapore, Orchard, Marina Bay
  - Identify 10 target merchants per area

2. **Build Pitch Decks**
  - Version A: High-volume area (Central)
  - Version B: Premium dining (Marina Bay)
  - Version C: Neighborhood restaurants

3. **Launch Pilot Recruitment**
  - Target: 3+ merchant commitments
  - Focus: Independent/small chains

### Phase 0 Validation (Weeks 2-6)

**Merchant Outreach Goal:** 3+ signed LOIs

**Target Merchant Types:**
1. Japanese/Korean: Independent ramen, Korean BBQ
2. Western Casual: Burgers, pasta competing with chains
3. Cafe/Brunch: Specialty coffee, brunch spots

**Sales Objection Prep:**
- "How many users?" → Show cohort size + spend data
- "What's the ROI?" → Frame as CAC vs. customer LTV
- "I do Instagram ads" → "Ours are behavior-based, not interest-based"

### Data Enhancements (Optional)

1. **District mapping:** (lat, lng) → district name lookup
2. **Cuisine tagging:** Top 500 merchants by cuisine type
3. **User home/work inference:** Persistent location data
4. **Merchant deduplication:** Standardize merchant names
